        Tinker Toys, Mechano and Radio Shack Electronics Project Kits fostered passion and aptitude for building. By age
        8, the programming bug had bitten when the family got a used Commodore 64 with some BASIC reference manuals and
        back issues of Run magazine. Formerly an Apple Technical Support agent, and then a distributed system developer

        thesaurus/dictionary/spellchecker—no Internet required. Bad signage and websites make Dev-Dev a sad panda. While

    <p><strong>Erin Bowman</strong>
        <br>Erin /ˈɛrɪn/
        <br><em>noun</em>
        <br>1.  The winner of an argument.
        <br>"The champion emerged from the debate like a victorious Erin."
        <br><em>verb</em>

        <br>As Manager of the Partner Support department, Erin is both Leader and Spirit Animal to the entire team, much
        like the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh's who were both diety and leader to their people, only way more Canadian. No
        one is really sure where Erin came from. Her first appearance was documented in the sleepy town of Saskatoon,
        where it's rumoured she spent her childhood. However, there have also been sightings in Malaysia, Singapore and
        Mexico. Some say Erin is a myth, others, a legend. Some say she guards untold riches beyond your wildest
        dreams, that can only be won by beating her at shinny. A word of warning though, Erin is undefeated.</p>

        in the winter and beer in the summer. Jodie is happiest when she is spending time outdoors and she loves trying
        new things.  She has just taken up paddleboarding with her daughters and they having a blast.  Jodie is so
        grateful that her mother’s love of gardening has been passed down to her.  This summer she managed to
